Utilize Express.js for handling HTTP requests and routing.
Database Integration:
Use MongoDB or any other database of your choice for data storage.
Implement CRUD operations for interacting with the database.
Submission:
You are required to submit the source code along with brief documentation on how to set up and
run the application.
Evaluation Criteria:
Completion of functional requirements.
Code quality, including readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
Efficient use of database operations and REST API design.
Working api endpoint is a plus point.
